# Acoustic Modeling Application
This is an application that analyzes audio files, specifically the __reverberation__ of certain locations, to understand if the location needs proper acoustic treatment. <br />

Hearing and understanding the speaker in a classroom are crucial factors in permitting students to comprehend the material being taught in lectures. The student learning experience in a classroom setting can vary greatly depending on the speakerâ€™s voice intelligibility, and problems such as long reverberation times resulting from an enclosed space not being treated properly can affect this hearing experience. <br />

Hence this application was created to allows users to import WAV and MP3 audio files of reverberation of enclosed space, assumed that the audio was recorded has at least _one second_ of reverberation time. The program can interpret any valid audio, however, is focused on analyzing the sound of a hand clap recorded around three meters away from a recording device. <br />

## Usage Instruction
To run this application, clone this repo to your local machine. Then, 
check out the requirement.txt for the list of packages that need to be pip installed.

Once acquired all files and libraries needed, run _app.py_ to access the application. <br />

## Credits
This project (Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling (SPIDAM) Project) was made under the instructions of Dr. Christian Navarro for the course COP2080 at Florida Polytechnic University.
