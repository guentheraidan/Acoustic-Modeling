# Acoustic Modeling Application
This is an application that analyzes audio files, specifically the reverberation of certain locations, to understand if the location needs proper acoustic treatment. <br />

Hearing and understanding the speaker in a classroom are crucial factors in permitting students to comprehend the material being taught in lectures. The student learning experience in a classroom setting can vary greatly depending on the speakerâ€™s voice intelligibility, and problems such as long reverberation times resulting from an enclosed space not being treated properly can affect this hearing experience. <br />

Hence this application was create specically to allows users to import WAV and MP3 audio files of reverberation of enclosed space, assumed that the audio was recorded has at least one second of reverberation time. The program can interpret any valid audio, however, is focused on analyzing the sound of a hand clap recorded around three meters away from a recording device. <br />

To run this application, download the following:
- app.py
- view.py
- model.py
- controller.py
- check out the requirement.txt for the list of packages that need to be pip installed

Once acquired all files and libraries needed, run app.py to access the application.
